# Geospatial-Application-Development-for-Primary-Field-Data

GIS is a platform for spatial data infrastructure. Primary objective of it is to provide educational platform for learners to learn about spatial information and learn how these modern
tools can be used to solve real life problems. As a platform it is for people who range from those who can contribute data (mobile based point data collection to digitization of published
maps) to those who can analyze the data to infer useful social knowledge. It is a digital way to collect, aggregate, access, analyze data and then provide decision support to the community.

The aim is to create map infrastructure for the various projects of TDSC like Thakkar Bappa Yojana, Rural Water Supply Scheme, Deonadi project etc. The web interface would help in
viewing, editing, updating and analysing the projects by the concerned people. Modules for querying, analysing and presenting the data could also be included in the objectives. The data
is to be presented on the site so that it can be easily understood and used by the various organisations and authorities or researchers planning to work on development in rural areas.

As far as the significance and need of a web GIS system, it is being highly used in many industries like telecom, agriculture, surveying etc. Such a system plays an extremely important
role in the telecoms and network services. It is used in planning, collecting, analysing and storing the complex network designs that are needed to come up with a working architecture
in the field of telecoms. GIS can be used to provide information that can be used to plan what crops need to be grown in what areas of the farm depending on the soil structure and soil
composition. Land use planning will depend on the information provided by GIS in deciding which part of the land should be subjected to what land use. It becomes easier to know what
crops will thrive on what part of the land and this helps in improving yields. GIS stores data that can be relevant in community development. The data can provide insights that can help
inform the planning of the community land based on the needs of the community. This particular project is significant because of its very nature of providing a visualizing tool
to common people. To know and understand the projects and government schemes being introduced and implemented in their location in a more intuitive and user-friendly manner.
