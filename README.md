Geospatial-Application-Development-for-Primary-Field-Data

GIS is a platform for spatial data infrastructure. Primary objective of it is to provide
educational platform for learners to learn about spatial information and learn how these modern
tools can be used to solve real life problems. As a platform it is for people who range from
those who can contribute data (mobile based point data collection to digitization of published
maps) to those who can analyze the data to infer useful social knowledge. It is a digital way to
collect, aggregate, access, analyze data and then provide decision support to the community. The web interface would help in
viewing, editing, updating and analysing the projects by the concerned people. Modules for
querying, analysing and presenting the data could also be included in the objectives. The data
is to be presented on the site so that it can be easily understood and used by the various
organisations and authorities or researchers planning to work on development in rural areas.
